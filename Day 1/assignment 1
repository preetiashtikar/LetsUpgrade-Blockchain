ASSIGNMENT 1

What is your understanding of Blockchain?
It is a combination of two technologies i.e. distributed database and cryptography where information is verifiable, unchangeable, tamper-proof, immutable. 
Blockchain is a chain of blocks where each block contains block number,transaction record, previous block key and mining key.  

What is the core problem Blockchain trying to solve?

Internet was not able to be verifiable, authenticity, security, need of powerful third party for trust.

What are the few features which Blockchain will give you?

huge security boost
Immutable
Decentralized
Unchangeable
Verifiable
no hacking
data transparency
no middleman


What all things does a Block contain?

Block number
Transaction record
Previous block key
Mining key

How is the verifiability of Blockchain has been attained?

For example , same data is sent to 100 people, each of them generates the fingerprint. 
Then everyones fingerprint is matched if everyone got the same fingerprint then the data is correct and if any of them get different fingerprint than the majority it means the data is tampered or is incorrect.
Same way it is attained in blockchain, data is stored into many different servers and is verified by using fingerprints, keys or digital signature.
